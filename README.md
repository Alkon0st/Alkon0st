# 👋 Hi I'm Adriane
## 👁️About Me👁️
- I'm a recent computer science graduate of CSULB (California State University of Long Beach). I am excited to go through my journey of being a software developer. I got interest on every corner of tech from automations, web developments(front/back-end & devops), data management & science,  graphics programming & cybersecurity. I got many experience within web development but I am actively learning and and exploring new areas to deepen my technical expertise.
